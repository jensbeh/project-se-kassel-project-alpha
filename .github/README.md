## What is Project Alpha?
Project Alpha is a pixel art game played from a bird's eye view. You can fight, trade and explore. All this in a beautiful environment surrounded by NPCs, enemies and animals. But watch out! The game requires a tactical approach in order not to die in the wilderness.

### Story
The year is 2433, Earth's resources and materials have been completely depleted by human greed. Earth is no longer a viable planet. There is garbage everywhere and more and more people die of epidemics or CO2 - poisoning. 

A research facility planned with last hope to find a new viable environment for a group of selected people and researchers. A black hole was discovered and raised the hope, of finding a new planet. That is where the group should travel, to start a new life and save humanity. The group set out on a mission. The mission "Project Alpha" was launched.

### Combat system
The player can defend himself against the opponents by defeating them with weapons. But the opponents are not easy to defeat, because they can defend themselves as well.
